      <h1>Hello, I'm Erick Patino</h1>
      <h3>Culinary Artist Turned Tech Enthusiast</h3>

      <p>
        I started my career in the culinary arts, earning my degree at Utah
        Valley University and exploring my passion for flavors and creativity.
        Over time, I discovered a new interest in technology, captivated by the
        problem-solving challenges and innovative possibilities it offers.
        <br /><br />

        Today, I'm channeling my creativity from the kitchen into coding and
        tech projects. With experience in procurement and a strong foundation in
        culinary arts, I bring a unique perspective to the tech world. I'm
        excited to continue growing my skills and building solutions that blend
        my love for creation with my technical curiosity.
