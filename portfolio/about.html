        <b>Background: </b>I began my journey by earning a degree in
        <b>Culinary Arts</b> from Utah Valley University (UVU), where I honed my
        skills in cooking, food science, and kitchen management. After
        graduating, I transitioned into a role as a Procurement Agent, where I
        developed a keen eye for detail, strong organizational skills, and an
        understanding of supply chain management. Working in procurement has
        given me valuable experience in negotiation, strategic planning, and
        data analysis. Now, I’m excited to transition into the tech industry,
        where I can combine my analytical skills and creative problem-solving
        abilities with my growing knowledge in web development and programming.
        This career shift aligns with my passion for technology and my goal of
        pursuing a more technical, innovative role.
