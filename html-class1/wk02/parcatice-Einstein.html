      <h1>Albert Einstein: The Revolutionary Physicist (article heading)</h1>
      <h2>Brief Biography of Work</h2>
      <img src="images/albert.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein" width="350" />

      <p>
        Albert Einstein was a renowned theoretical physicist who developed the
        theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work
        is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein
        is best known to the general public for his mass-energy equivalence
        formula E = mc<sup>2.</sup> (Superscript)
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1921, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics (important) for
        his services to Theoretical Physics (important) and his discovery of the
        law of the photoelectric effect. This work was pivotal in establishing
        the quantum theory.

      <h2>Famous Quote</h2>
      <h3>
        One of Einstein's most famous quotes reflects his views on curiosity and
        learning:
      </h3>

      <p><q>I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious. </q></p>

      <p>
        This quote encapsulates Einstein's humble nature and his belief in the
        power of curiosity to drive scientific discovery and personal growth.
      </p>

      <h3>Growing Up</h3>

      <p>
        Growing Up Born on March 14, 1879, in (bold)
        <b>Ulm, Germany </b> (bold), Einstein grew up in a secular Jewish
        family. As a child, Einstein displayed an intense curiosity about nature
        and an ability to understand complex mathematical concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the age of five, Einstein's father showed him a pocket compass, and
        Einstein realized that something in "empty" (emphasized) space acted
        upon the needle. This experience made a deep and lasting impression on
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite early speech difficulties, Einstein was a top student in
        elementary school, particularly excelling in mathematics.
