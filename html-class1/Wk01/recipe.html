      <h2>Air Fryer Mozzarella Sticks</h2>
      <p>
        Indulge in the perfect blend of crispy and gooey with our Air Fryer
        Mozzarella Sticks. This healthier take on the classic appetizer delivers
        all the flavor without the guilt of deep frying. Stringy mozzarella is

        perfection. The result? A satisfyingly crunchy exterior that gives way
        to a molten cheese center. Serve these irresistible bites with your
        favorite marinara sauce for dipping, and watch them disappear at your
        next gathering. Quick to make and even quicker to vanish, these
        mozzarella sticks are sure to become your new go-to snack.
